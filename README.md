# hello
My first repository on GitHub!

# Creating this repository is the first step for me in making a cybersecurity portfolio.

# A README is a text file that provides an overview of your project. Some example sections you may want to include are:
# A Project Title: 
A descriptive title related to the project that may interest your prospective employer. Do not title your project “Portfolio Project”; instead, try adding a title that defines the project you have worked on.

# A Project Introduction: 
Two to three sentences that state the problem you solved, the data used for the project, and your modeling results.

# Modeling and Evaluation: 
Name and describe the models you used for the project and any corresponding evaluation metrics.

# Conclusion: 
Your recommendations for solving the problem and a description of any future steps you want to take to expand on your project.
